> Howdy stranger, and welcome to Tick Tick Za, the world's first ever 10 second pizza kitchen! Here at Tick Tick Za, pizza scientists and engineers have created the optimal method for producing high quality pizzas at record breaking times.
>
> The kitchen can be a bit tricky to navigate at first, but with proper training you'll be a pro pizza chef in no time. It all starts with production. Every 10 seconds pizza dough will roll out of the conveyor belt at the back of the kitchen. Your job will be to complete each task as quickly as you can so the customer can leave satisfied with their perfect pizza. But three wrong orders and our artificial intelligence, Z.A Z.A, will shut us down due to safety compliant violations. Also, be careful, the machines can become overworked and will run into problems throughout your shift.
> 
> Try and take on this tough challenge and beat all 20 levels!
